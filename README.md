#Introduction

The purpose of this lab was to program the ATLYS (FPGA) in VHDL code so that it would output an HDMI as an output signal.  This output signal was of an oscilloscope, which included the grid design, the time and voltage trigger markers, which respond to button clicks on the FPGA, as well as two input channels, although these have not been fully implemented yet.  

#Implementation

To start off this design, the following files were given: 


Then, this picture was made to give overview and insight to how the overall program would run.

The Double Counter box is expanded below, as it was too complex to fit in a small space:
